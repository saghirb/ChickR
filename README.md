## Data Science Thinking: Chick Weight Data

### Objective

To present "Data Scientist: What am I thinking?" with the R Chick Weight data. 

### Why? What? How?

After teaching R courses, I am often asked how do all the things fit together. A fair question. This is one attempt to answer that question. 

I will write in a style that will be like "thinking out aloud" and try to keep to the process that I tend to follow. 

### Warning

This is just one point of view and others may differ in their views. I don't see this as a problem as it demonstrates that there is no one right answer which makes data science even more fun :o)

### Feedback and contributions welcome!
