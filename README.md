## ChickR

R tutorial using the R *Chick Weight* data. 

### Objective

To present "Data Scientist: What am I thinking?" when doing _Data Science_. 

### Why?

After teaching R courses, I am often asked how do all the things fit together. This is one of my attempt to answer that question. Feedback and contributions welcome!

### Warning

This is just one view and others may differ in their views. I don't see this as a problem as it demonstrates that there is no one right answer which makes it even more fun :o)
